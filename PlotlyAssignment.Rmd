## Data

The plot on the next slide shows the price of bitcoin in 2017. But first these libraries need to be loaded. 

```{r library}
library(plotly)
library(quantmod)
```

The daily prices are downloaded with the package quantmod.

```{r data}
Bitcoin = window(getSymbols('BTCUSD=X', auto.assign=F), start="2017-01-01")
Df = data.frame(Date=index(Bitcoin), coredata(Bitcoin))
```

## Interactive Plot

The plot shows the daily price of bitcoin. The slider below the plot can be used to adjust the time window.

```{r plot, echo=F}
Df %>% plot_ly(x=~Date, type="ohlc", open = ~BTCUSD.X.Open, close = ~BTCUSD.X.Close, high = ~BTCUSD.X.High, low = ~BTCUSD.X.Low)
```
